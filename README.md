# CIS2013_Final

# Favorite part of class
## The ease of learning through example. I get distracted and side-tracked really easily when reading a book, so I find it easier to learn how to do things by seeing it done then doing it. Otherwise, I learn things slower. The labs really helped with that.

# Least favorite part of class
##  This would be the same for any class, but it would be reading the book. I get distracted too easily when reading, so I would prefer courses that had zero reliance on books to read, paper or digital. I'm ok with power point slides that teach basically the same thing, but walls of text as they are often called just make me want to stare at a wall.

# What could chage to make it better
## Maybe more power point slides that show key points of a particular learning objective. The books have their way of long-winding things that are just annoying. And they usually dont even teach in the way God would want it done.
